#' A Gallery of Animations in Statistics and Utilities to Create Animations
#'
#' This package contains a variety functions for animations in statistics which
#' could probably aid in teaching statistics and data analysis; it also has
#' several utilities to export R animations to other formats.
#'
#' This package mainly makes use of HTML & JavaScript and R windows graphics
#' devices (such as \code{\link{x11}}) to demonstrate animations in statistics;
#' other kinds of output such as Flash (SWF) or GIF animations or PDF animations
#' are also available if required software packages have been installed. See
#' below for details on each type of animation.
#'
#' @section On-screen Animations: It's natural and easy to create an animation
#'   in R using the windows graphics device, e.g. in \code{x11()} or
#'   \code{windows()}. A basic scheme is like the Example 1 (see below).
#'
#'   On-screen animations do not depend on any third-party software, but the
#'   rendering speed of the windows graphics devices is often slow, so the
#'   animation might not be smooth (especially under Linux and Mac OS).
#'
#' @section HTML Pages: The generation of HTML animation pages does not rely on
#'   any third-party software either, and we only need a web browser to watch
#'   the animation. See \code{\link{saveHTML}}.
#'
#'   The HTML interface is just like a movie player -- it comes with a series of
#'   buttons to control the animation (play, stop, next, previous, ...).
#'
#'   This HTML approach is flexible enough to be used even in Rweb, which means
#'   we do not really have to install R to create animations! There is a demo in
#'   \code{system.file('misc', 'Rweb', 'demo.html', package = 'animation')}. We
#'   can use \code{\link{saveHTML}} to create animations directly in Rweb; this
#'   can be helpful when we do not have R or cannot install R.
#'
#' @section GIF Animations: If ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick has been installed,
#'   we can use \code{\link{im.convert}} or \code{\link{gm.convert}} to create a
#'   GIF animation (combining several R plots together), or use
#'   \code{\link{saveGIF}} to create a GIF animation from an R code chunk.
#'
#' @section Flash Animations: If SWF Tools has been installed, we can use
#'   \code{\link{saveSWF}} to create a Flash animation (again, combining R
#'   plots).
#'
#' @section PDF Animations: If LaTeX is present in the system, we can use
#'   \code{\link{saveLatex}} to insert animations into a PDF document and watch
#'   the animation using the Adobe reader.
#'
#'   The animation is created by the LaTeX package \code{animate}.
#'
#' @section Video: The function \code{\link{saveVideo}} can use FFmpeg to
#'   convert images to various video formats (e.g. \file{mp4}, \file{avi} and
#'   \file{wmv}, etc).
