Creation of This Website,http://r.yihui.name/news/index.htm,Yihui Xie,"<p>Personally I don't like those complicated mathematical theories... And I believe many people hold the same opinion with me. I want to find some simpler approaches to learn statistics. That's my original motivation to create such a website.</p><p>Sure, I'm too lazy. Simulation and graphics alone cannot contribute to mathematics and statistics directly. So, we should face the reality anyway... We should <em>prove</em> the effect of gradient descent algorithm <em>X<sub>n+1</sub> = X<sub>n</sub> - ¦ÃF'(X<sub>n</sub>)</em> instead of just giving an illustration. </p>","Sat, 06 Oct 2007 00:00:00 GMT",1,Web
The Way of Animation Found,http://r.yihui.name/misc/java.htm,Yihui Xie,"<p>I spent really a lot of time on searching for a proper way for animations. After <a href=""../misc/gif_pdf_grDev.htm"">several trials</a>, I found <a href=""../misc/java.htm"">JavaScript could help me</a>. <acronym title=""The HTML Document Object Model"">HTML DOM</acronym> is really important. </p><p>Cheers! Users won't need R or any other special programs to see my animations now -- just a browser supporting JavaScript is enough. </p>","Sun, 14 Oct 2007 00:00:00 GMT",2,Technique
