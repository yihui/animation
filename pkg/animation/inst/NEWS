  that the argument 'FUN' needs to be defined 
  without braces. (thanks, Peter Ehlers)

		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.1-1


NEW FEATURES

    o saveMovie() gained two new options: 'clean' to
  determin whether to delete individual image frames
  after conversion; 'cmd.fun' to decide which function
  to be used to invoke the OS command (system or
  shell)

MINOR CHANGES

    o improved the way to find 'convert' for saveMovie()
  under Windows which is a long-lasting confusing
  problem for Windows users (thanks, Yishuo Deng)
    o fixed a bug caused by the 'outdir' option in
  ani.options() when 'outdir' is a relative path
  which makes ani.stop() fail (thanks, Paul Murrell)

NEW FEATURES

    o three demos to illustrate recursion added: see 
  demo('recur.leaf'), demo('recur.snow') and
  demo('recur.tree'); thanks, Taiyun!
    o demo('Xmas') added

MINOR CHANGES

    o fixed a bug for the option 'interval': in the
  non-interactive environment, ani.start() and
  ani.stop() should use ani.options()$interval
  to obtain the REAL 'interval' (other than 0)
    o a new argument 'install.animate' for saveLatex()
  to install the LaTeX 'animate' if it does not exist
    o a new argument 'width.cutoff' for tidy.source()
  to decide the width of deparsed code
    o removed the code to install ImageMagick in
  saveMovie()
    o changed shell() to system() in saveMovie()
  (thanks, R. Woodrow Setzer)
    o updated the LaTeX package 'animate'

  the 'hit or miss' Monte Carlo integration
    o a new function MC.samplemean() to demonstrate
  the 'sample mean' Monte Carlo integration
    o a new function price.ani() to demonstrate 
  the stock prices changing within a time span
  (inspired by Shen Dai)

MINOR CHANGES

  saveMovie(); e.g. 'imconvert' under some Windows
  platforms (Thanks, James Pustejovsky)

		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-9


NEW FEATURES

    o saveLatex() to embed the animation into a
  LaTeX document (with LaTeX package 'animate').
    o a new option 'imgdir' added to ani.options()
  so that users can specify the name of the image 
  directory
    o a message will come up if the animation option
  'nmax' is changed; this will help users know the
  actual number of images in the current session;
  this message will only show in interactive mode
    o saveMovie() will try to install ImageMagick
  automatically if 'convert' not found

MINOR CHANGES

    o query ani.options('interval') will return 0 if
  the animation is run in a non-interactive mode;
  this will save much time typically in 'R CMD check'
  (Thanks to Prof Ripley)
    o the option 'nmax' will be adjusted to the 
  *actual* number of images in the directory 
  ani.options('imgdir'), because sometimes the actual
  number of images does not equal to ani.options('nmax')
    o shortened the descriptions in Rd files and 
  several changes in documentations 
    o fixed several buglets in ani.stop()
    o changed the 'while' loop to 'for' loop in
  brownian.motion(); this will shorten the code by
  two lines
    o ani.options('ani.dev') can be the name of a
  function (character), e.g. "png"

NEW FEATURES

    o moving.block() to plot a subset of data by blocks
    o ani.options() gained a new argument 'loop' to 
  control the iteration of the animation in an HTML
  page: TRUE to interate for infinite times, and FALSE
  not to interate (only play once). Thanks, Marcin Kozak!

MINOR CHANGES

    o fixed a bug for in ani.stop(): when 
  ani.options(footer = FALSE), ani.stop() will report
  an error for non-existent object 'footer'; I should
  have used the value ani.options("footer") in the code.
  Thanks, Marcin Kozak!

  a custom string to be written in the HTML page
  as the footer information. (Thanks, Jorge Nieves)

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o tidy.source2() was merged into tidy.source(),
  and tidy.source() now returns a list of character
  vectors and also gains an argument 'output' to

  Galton box or Bean Machine. (Thanks for the 
  inspiration from Roger Koenker)

  demonstrate the Brownian Motion using Google
  Visulization API.

MINOR CHANGES

    o The Shapiro-Wilk normality tests are performed
  to independent sample means instead of the original
  'cumulative' data. (Thanks, Duncan Murdoch)
    o Arguments 'col.contour' and 'col.arrow' added
  to grad.desc() to specify the colors for the contour
  lines and arrows freely; the graphical parameters
  are no longer specified within the function using
  par().
    o The path of SWF Tools in saveSWF() will be 
  quoted by shQuote() instead of dQuote().

		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-0


NEW FEATURES

    o ani.options() added to control animation parameters.
  It is much better than ani.control() in previous
  versions.
    o ani.start() and ani.stop() are modified. The former
  function opens a graphics device and the latter one
  create an HTML page with a new interface.
    o A wiki has been build to support this package:
  http://animation.yihui.name (AniWiki: Animations in
  Statistics)

MINOR CHANGES

    o Graphical parameters can be set in ... argument for:
  brownian.motion(), buffon.needle(), clt.ani(), conf.int(),
  cv.ani(), lln.ani(), mwar.ani(), newton.method(),
  sample.cluster(), sample.strat().
    o P-values are computed in clt.ani() to check the
  normality (using 'shapiro.test()').

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o The vignette is abandoned and stopped being updated;
  the wiki http://animation.yihui.name will be used instead.
    o The way to create HTML animations is significantly
  changed for the sake of a better interface and more
  flexible control of animations. Read the help files 
  for ani.control(), ani.start(), ani.stop().
    o The function savePNG() removed. The new way to
  create animation frames allows ANY graphics devices.
    o ani.control() and checkargs() removed. The new
  way to control animation parameters is more flexible.
