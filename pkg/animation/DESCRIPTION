Description: This package consists of various functions for animations in
  statistics, covering many areas such as probability theory, mathematical
  statistics, multivariate statistics, nonparametric statistics, sampling
  survey, linear models, time series, computational statistics, data mining
  and machine learning. These functions might be of help in teaching
  statistics and data analysis. Also provided in this package are a series
  of approaches to save animation to various formats, e.g. Flash, GIF, HTML
  page and PDF.
