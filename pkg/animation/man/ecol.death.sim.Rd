\title{
A Simulation of Death of Two Species
}
\description{
A simulation of the death of two species with certain probabilities.
}
\usage{
ecol.death.sim(nr = 10, nc = 10, num.sp = c(50, 50), col.sp = c(1, 2), 
    pch.sp = c(1, 2), col.die = 1, pch.die = 4, cex = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{nr, nc}{
number of rows and columns of the field (plants grow on a \code{nr} x \code{nc} grid)
}
  \item{num.sp}{
number of two plants respectively
}
  \item{col.sp,pch.sp}{
colors and point symbols of the two species respectively
}
  \item{col.die, pch.die, cex}{
the color, point symbol and magnification to annotate the plant which dies (symbol default to be an `X')
}
  \item{\dots}{
other arguments passed to \code{\link[graphics]{plot}} to set up the plot  
}
}
\details{
Suppose there are two plant species in a field: A and B. One of them will die at each time and a new plant will grow in the place where the old plant died; the species of the new plant depends on the proportions of two species: the larger the proportion is, the greater the probability for this species to come up will be.
}
\note{
\code{2 * nmax} image frames will actually be produced, and the option \code{nmax} will be adjusted to \code{2 * nmax} in the end.
}
\value{
a vector (factor) containing 1's and 2's, denoting the plants finally survived
}

This animation is motivated by a question raised from a student in biology to show the evolution of two species.
