\title{ Simulation of Buffon's Needle }
\description{
  This function provides a simulation for the problem of Buffon's Needle, which is one of the oldest problems in the field of geometrical probability. 
}
\usage{
buffon.needle(l = 0.8, d = 1, redraw = TRUE, mat = matrix(c(1, 3, 2, 3), 2),
    heights = c(3, 2), col = c("lightgray", "red", "gray", "red", "blue",
    "black", "red"), expand = 0.4, type = "l", ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{l}{ numerical. length of the needle; shorter than \code{d}. }
  \item{d}{ numerical. distances between lines; it should be longer than \code{l}. }
  \item{redraw}{ logical. redraw former `needles' or not for each drop. }
  \item{mat, heights}{ arguments passed to \code{\link[graphics]{layout}} to set the layout of the three graphs. }
  \item{col}{ a character vector of length 7 specifying the colors of: background of the area between parallel lines, the needles, the sin curve, points below / above the sin curve, estimated \eqn{\pi} values, and the true \eqn{\pi} value. }
  \item{expand}{ a numerical value defining the expanding range of the y-axis when plotting the estimated \eqn{\pi} values: the \code{ylim} will be \code{(1 +/- expand) * pi}. }
  \item{type}{ an argument passed to \code{\link[graphics:plot.default]{plot}} when plotting the estimated \eqn{\pi} values (default to be lines). }
  \item{\dots}{ other arguments passed to \code{\link[graphics:plot.default]{plot}} when plotting the values of estimated \eqn{\pi}. }
}
\details{
  This is quite an old problem in probability. For mathematical background, please refer to \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon's_needle} or \url{http://www.mste.uiuc.edu/reese/buffon/buffon.html}.
  
  `Needles' are denoted by segments on the 2D plane, and dropped randomly to check whether they cross the parallel lines. Through many times of `dropping' needles, the approximate value of \eqn{\pi} can be calculated out.
  
  There are three graphs made in each step: the top-left one is a simulation of the scenario, the top-right one is to help us understand the connection between dropping needles and the mathematical method to estimate \eqn{\pi}, and the bottom one is the result for each dropping.
 
}
\value{
The values of estimated \eqn{\pi} are returned as a numerical vector (of length \code{nmax}).

\note{ 
Note that \code{redraw} will affect the speed of the simulation (animation) to a great deal if the control argument \code{nmax} (in \code{\link{ani.options}}) is quite large, so you'd better specify it as \code{FALSE} when doing a large amount of simulations.
