		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-3


NEW FEATURES

    o The famous 'pollen' data added. See the example
  for finding the letters hidden in the data.
    o A function quincunx() added to simulate the
  Galton box or Bean Machine. (Thanks, Roger Koenker)
    o A function least.squares() added to show the 
  ordinary least square process.
    o A function BM.circle() added to show the
  Brownian Motion in a circle.
    o A function g.brownian.motion() added to 
  demonstrate the Brownian Motion using Google
  Visulization API.

MINOR CHANGES

    o The Shapiro-Wilk normality tests are performed
  to independent sample means instead of the original
  'cumulative' data. (Thanks, Duncan Murdoch)
    o Arguments 'col.contour' and 'col.arrow' added
  to grad.desc() to specify the colors for the contour
  lines and arrows freely; the graphical parameters
  are no longer specified within the function using
  par().
    o The path of SWF Tools in saveSWF() will be 
  quoted by shQuote() instead of dQuote(). 
  (Thanks, zhoulvjun)

TO APPEAR 
    
    o A function boot.loess() added to show the
  bootstrapping effects on loess().
    o A function cart.ani() to show the splitting
  process of classification and regression trees.
    o saveLatex() to embed the animation into a
  LaTeX document (with LaTeX package 'animate').

		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-2


NEW FEATURES

    o A new function Rosling.bubbles() added to show the
  bubbles animations like those used in Hans Rosling's 
  talk.

MINOR CHANGES

    o The argument 'swftools' is double quoted so that
  the SWF utilities can be executed correctly when the
  path contains spaces. (Thanks, Geng Yang)

		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-1


NEW FEATURES

    o The package has provided a wrapper to produce Flash
  animations using SWF Tools: saveSWF()
    o A demo 'wordrotation' added to show the basic
  method to make animations. More demos will be added
  in future releases.

MINOR CHANGES

    o A new argument 'para' added to saveMovie() so that
  the graphics parameters can be set for the device.

		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-0


NEW FEATURES

    o ani.options() added to control animation parameters.
  It is much better than ani.control() in previous
  versions.
    o ani.start() and ani.stop() are modified. The former
  function opens a graphics device and the latter one
  create an HTML page with a new interface.
    o A wiki has been build to support this package:
  http://animation.yihui.name (AniWiki: Animations in
  Statistics)

MINOR CHANGES

    o Graphical parameters can be set in ... argument for:
  brownian.motion(), buffon.needle(), clt.ani(), conf.int(),
  cv.ani(), lln.ani(), mwar.ani(), newton.method(),
  sample.cluster(), sample.strat().
    o P-values are computed in clt.ani() to check the
  normality (using 'shapiro.test()').

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o The vignette is abandoned and stopped being updated;
  the wiki http://animation.yihui.name will be used instead.
    o The way to create HTML animations is significantly
  changed for the sake of a better interface and more
  flexible control of animations. Read the help files 
  for ani.control(), ani.start(), ani.stop().
    o The function savePNG() removed. The new way to
  create animation frames allows ANY graphics devices.
    o ani.control() and checkargs() removed. The new
  way to control animation parameters is more flexible.

  cross-validation to find the optimum number of features

  to be "clipboard".

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

  method. 
 

MINOR CHANGES

    o A special function checkargs() is added to validate 
  animation arguments, which can promote the efficiency 
  of animation functions. 
    o It doesn't need Sys.sleep() when creating HTML pages,
  so the code is modified to avoid suspending in this case.

  parameters can be more uniform and the scalability of the
  animation functions will also be better. All the animation 
  functions are chanaged accordingly.

  we do cross-validation, the splitting of trainig set and test set
  will change (instead of splitting 1:n into k parts). The tick 
  marks of x-axis will change accordingly.
