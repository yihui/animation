====== About this wiki ======

===== History & Developments =====

You can read the [[wiki:developments|history and developments]] of this wiki.

===== Usage =====

==== Wiki syntax ====

Please learn the wiki [[wiki:syntax]] first if you are not familiar with Dokuwiki; and you may practise in the [[wiki:playground]]

==== Animation syntax ====

Please refer to the [[animation_example|animation example page]] and [[animation_plugin|plugin page]] to learn how to insert animations into wiki pages and use the HTML animation interface.

==== Math syntax ====

Please refer to the [[math|mathematical formula page]] to learn how to insert mathematical formulae into wiki pages. I assume you have learned enough knowledge about ''TeX/LaTeX''.

==== Access permission ====

Ordinary visitors and registered users have different permissions:

  * all visitors can read/edit any page
  * [[http://animation.yihui.name/doku.php?id=start&do=register|registered users]] are allowed to [[doku>wiki:faq:addpages|create new pages]]

==== Uploading ====

As this wiki is financially supported by [[wiki:yihui_xie|Yihui]] alone, the space is quite limited for uploading materials; thus you may consider uploading your stuff to other file/image hosting sites, e.g.

  * Images: [[http://photobucket.com|Photobucket]] (recommended((because it has a bulk uploader and the filenames will not be changed; it is ideal for uploading animation frames))), [[http://picasaweb.google.com|Picasa]], or [[http://www.flickr.com|Flickr]], etc.
  * Files: [[http://www.mediafire.com|MediaFile]], etc.

Or you can just send the files to me via Email [[xie@yihui.name]] and I'll upload them for you (to [[http://r-forge.r-project.org/|R-Forge]]).

==== Browsing ====

The recommended screen resolution is 1280x1024 px, as many animations are wider than 600px or higher than 600px. In that case, 800x600 px is a little bit too low, and 1024x768 might not be high enough to view all parts of the animation (including the controlling buttons, etc). Besides, the animations are driven by JS code, so make sure your browser supports JS or you have enabled JS in your browser.
