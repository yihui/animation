====== Insert animations in ''AniWiki'' ======

Please read the explanations in the [[animation_plugin|plugin page]] to understand how animations work in ''AniWiki''.

The syntax for inserting animations in ''AniWiki'' is like this:

<code>
<ani id url type max height interval|title>
description
</ani>
</code>

:!: Always bear in mind that you have provided a correct url, i.e. your images can be accessed by such a series of addresses: ''url + i + type'', where ''i'' is an integer giving the filename of each frame.

===== Rotation of a word ''Animation'' =====

In the introduction page of the [[animation:start|package ''animation'']], I have used a rotating word as the beginning example. Now 30 images from that example are uploaded to this site, so here we are able to create an HTML animation page as follows:

<code>
<ani example http://animation.yihui.name/_media/wiki: 
png 30 300 0.1|An animation example>
Here is the description for the animation.
</ani>
</code>

The above code will generate the result below:

<ani example http://animation.yihui.name/_media/wiki: 
png 30 300 0.1|An animation example>
Here is the description for the animation.
</ani>

===== Buffon's Needle =====

Here is an example illustrating how to upload images to other websites and cite them here. I have generated 100 animation frames from the function ''buffon.needle()'' in package ''animation'' and uploaded them to [[http://photobucket.com|Photobucket]]. You can view all the images in my album [[http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll181/xieyihui/buffon_s_needle/?start=all|buffon's needle]].

<code>
<ani buffon http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll181/xieyihui/buffon_s_needle/ 
png 100 600 0.1|Demonstration of Buffon's Needle>
Suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each the same width, 
and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle 
will lie across a line between two strips?
</ani>
</code>

Here is the result (it can take one or two minutes to download all the images, depending on your internet connection):

<ani buffon http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll181/xieyihui/buffon_s_needle/ 
png 100 500 0.1|Demonstration of Buffon's Needle>
