===== About this guy =====

Yihui has a great passion for statistics, especially for statistical graphics. He thinks his IQ might be lower than the average level :-(, because he is often confused by statistical theories and methods in classes. Not being able to follow those smart guys :-?, every now and then he chooses to doze off in the back of the classroom :-X or stand in the front to show others his animations LOL (in order that he should not doze off again).

To know more about this guy, please visit his [[http://www.yihui.name/en/index.php|Blog]] or read his [[http://www.yihui.name/cv/cv_yihui_en.htm|CV]]. Chinese visitors may also wish to visit his [[http://www.yihui.name/cn/index.php|Chinese Blog]].

===== What they say about his work =====

Drop me a few lines here if you didn't doze off when browsing this wiki.((Part of the reviews are from the [[http://www.yihui.name/en/guestbook.php|guestbook]] of my blog and my emails. If you think anyone of them is inappropriate to be posted here, please feel free to remove the words by yourself.)) For example, "Hi sleepy guy, my dog seems to be interested in your animations. When I woke up I found he was moving the mouse browsing your web pages." :-D Don't worry about your email addresses because there is a mechanism to protect them from harvesting bots -- the addresses will be obfuscated.
