In mathematics, Buffon&#039;s needle problem is a question first posed in the 18th century by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon:

</p>
<blockquote><div class="no">
 Suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two strips?</div></blockquote>

<p>

Using integral geometry, the problem can be solved to get a Monte Carlo method to approximate Ï€.
