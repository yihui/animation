In mathematics, Buffon's needle problem is a question first posed in the 18th century by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon:

> Suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two strips?

Using integral geometry, the problem can be solved to get a Monte Carlo method to approximate $\pi$.

There are three graphs made in each step: the top-left one is a simulation of the scenario, the top-right one is to help us understand the connection between dropping needles and the mathematical method to estimate $\pi$, and the bottom one is the result for each dropping.
