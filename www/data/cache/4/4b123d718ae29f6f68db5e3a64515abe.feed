            <description>Please read the explanations in the plugin page to understand how animations work in AniWiki.

The syntax for inserting animations in AniWiki is like this:


&lt;ani id url type max height interval|title&gt;
description
&lt;/ani&gt;


:!: Always bear in mind that you have provided a correct url, i.e. your images can be accessed by such a series of addresses: url + i + type, where i is an integer giving the filename of each frame.</description>

            <link>http://animation.yihui.name/wiki:animation_plugin</link>
            <description>The animation plugin can generate an animation from a sequence of images, e.g. 1.png, 2.png, 3.png, ... The animation is driven by HTML &amp; JS.

            <description>The predecessor of AniWiki is Animated Statistics Using R, which was created in Oct 2007 by Yihui. As time goes on, he find there are two obvious disadvantages of this website: (1) the static HTML pages are not easy to maintain; (2) to build a whole gallery of animations by a single person is also difficult. Thus he changed his idea to create a wiki on May 26, 2008 so that everybody can participate in this project to contribute their brilliant ideas in creating animations in statistics.</description>

            <description>[Array] DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use wp&gt;Wiki, mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind. It is targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small companies. It has a simple but powerful syntax which makes sure the datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and eases the creation of structured texts. All data is stored in plain text files -- no database is required.</description>

            <description>The animation in the homepage will be changed aperiodically. All of the animations which were once used are listed in this page. If you want to submit one, please contact Yihui Xie first. The size of the image(s) had better be 400Ã—400 px. The format should be GIF.</description>

            <description>Based on the math plugin, I created a method for AniWiki to generate mathematical formulae, which is fairly similar to TeX/LaTeX.

Syntax


Dokuwiki Syntax:


$...text style mathematical formula...$
$$...display style mathematical formula...$$


I don't think I still need to explain what are textstyle and displaystyle in LaTeX. See the examples below.</description>

            <description>DokuWiki supports some simple markup language, which tries to make the datafiles to be as readable as possible. This page contains all possible syntax you may use when editing the pages. Simply have a look at the source of this page by pressing the Edit this page button at the top or bottom of the page. If you want to try something, just use the playground page. The simpler markup is easily accessible via quickbuttons, too.</description>
