=== Quick Help: ===

On this page you can add and remove permissions for namespaces and pages in your wiki.

The left pane displays all available namespaces and pages.

The form above allows you to see and modify the permissions of a selected user or group.

In the table below all currently set access control rules are shown. You can use it to quickly delete or change multiple rules.

Reading the [[doku>acl|official documentation on ACL]] might help you to fully understand how access control works in DokuWiki.
