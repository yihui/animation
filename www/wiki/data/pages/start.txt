====== AniWiki ======

''AniWiki'' aims to be a gallery for statistical animations in several subjects listed below. Most of the animations are created in the [[http://www.r-project.org|R]] environment. There is a special R package [[http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation|''animation'']] contributed by [[wiki:yihui_xie]] with the goal "//to turn ideas into animation, quickly and faithfully//". :!:[[wiki:start|Read more...]]

===== Developments =====

The predecessor of ''AniWiki'' is [[http://www.yihui.name/r|Animated Statistics Using R]], which was created in Oct 2007 by Yihui but later abandoned due to the inconvenience to maintain and lack of interaction. Thus a wiki was built on May 26, 2008 so that everybody can participate in this project to contribute their brilliant [[wiki:message|ideas]] in creating animations in statistics.
