The first line of this file contains a number, indicating
which notification messages should not be displayed. This
is the only information sent to dokuwiki.org when the
updatecheck option is enabled. You usually don't need to
change this number as it gets updated when you install the
new release - but to ignore a certain message set its
number here.
