		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.6

NEW FEATURES

  o add a new option ani.res() to ani.options(), to control the resolution of png, 
  jepg, bmp and tiff images when using saveGIF() (#99).

		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.5

MAJOR CHANGES

  o removed all examples from the package, since this package failed to pass R
  CMD check on CRAN for unknown reasons; all examples are still available on
  Github https://github.com/yihui/animation/tree/master/inst/examples and they
  will be moved to https://yihui.name/animation in the future

		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.4

BUG FIXES

  o saveGIF() on Windows might give an error message "the input line it too
  long" when the command to be passed to ImageMagick/GraphicsMagic is too long;
  now the command is quoted by double quotes (based on an answer to
  http://stackoverflow.com/q/682799/559676) (thanks, Aaron Dodd)

  o save*() functions should overwrite the output file (#50, #60).

		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.3

NEW FEATURES

  o added a new argument 'navigator' to saveHTML() so that we can remove the
  navigator conveniently without having to understand SciAnimator library

MAJOR CHANGES

  o the default value for the argument `other.opts` in saveVideo() was changed
  to '-pix_fmt yuv420p' when the output format is MP4 (Skye Bender-deMoll, #49)

  o the defunct functions highlight.def(), write.rss() and ani.news() were
  finally removed from this package

  o the functions ani.start() and ani.stop() are defunct and will be removed
  in the next version of this package; please use saveHTML() instead

  o the animation option `outdir` in ani.options() was removed because it
  was confusing to many users that the output is in a temporary directory by
  default; now all files are written relative to the current working
  directory (#31)

  o the animation option `convert` in ani.options() is expected to be the
  path to ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick _without_ quotes, i.e. not the
  shQuote() version (#35)

  o the animation option 'htmlfile' in ani.options() was removed, because it
  was only used in saveHTML() and g.brownian.motion(), and is not a general
  enough option

  o the 'clean' argument in saveVideo() was removed: images will be created
  in the temporary directory, and will not be explicitly cleaned (R will
  clean them then it quits)

		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.2

MINOR CHANGES

  o datasets in this package are lazy loaded now, which means we no longer need,
  for example, data(pollen) -- just use pollen

  o added an article in the articles/ directory of the package, which will be
  published in the Journal of Statistical Software; see citation('animation')

BUG FIXES

  o fixed #28: the single quotes in the example code of saveHTML() in the PDF
  manual were not correctly rendered (thanks, James Marca)

DOCUMENTATION

  o the animation website http://animation.yihui.name is being rebuilt with
  knitr and Jekyll on Github (contributions/pull requests are welcome):
  http://vis.supstat.com/categories.html#Animation-ref

		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.1

MINOR CHANGES

  o x- and y-axis in the top scatter plot in boot.iid() are switched;
  now x-axis is the sample value and y-axis is the index

  o Rosling.bubbles() was rewritten to avoid .Internal() and the usage
  was slightly changed (see documentation)


		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.0-6


NEW FEATURES

  o demo('elephant') to show a winking pink elephant; who said
  elephants cannot dance? (thanks, Neil Gunther)

  o all animations are using dev.hold() and dev.flush() now, so they
  will no longer flicker under Linux and Mac

MINOR CHANGES

  o saveGIF() and im.convert() returns the command for the conversion,
  which might be helpful for debugging. A note on the limit of
  ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick was added to the documentation of
  im.convert() (thanks, Florian Knorr)

  o fixed a typo in ?animation (imgname should be img.name; thanks,
  Neuwirth Erich)

  o ani.pause() gained an argument 'interval' to specify the time
  interval directly


		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.0-5


BUG FIXES

    o saveVideo() fails to recognize FFmpeg when R is in a
  non-interactive mode (thanks, Felipe Olmos)


MINOR CHANGES

    o saveHTML() will tell the user how to change the output dir



		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.0-4

NEW FEATURES

    o a new function boot.lowess() to examine the LOWESS fit with
  bootstrapping


BUG FIXES

    o saveSWF(): the path of images passed to SWF Tools has been fixed
  (using the absolute path instead of the relative one); the images
  are named like Rplot%03d.png now to avoid incorrect ordering under
  Windows (thanks, Michael Hoehle)


MINOR CHANGES

    o the dataset CLELAL09 gained a new variable 'team' to indicate
  the team that the rows correspond to



		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.0-3


NEW FEATURES

    o sim.qqnorm() gained a new argument 'last.plot' to do something
  after drawing the QQ plot, e.g. add a diagonal line (abline(0, 1))


MINOR CHANGES

    o for saveLatex(): when full.path = TRUE, \ will be replaced with
  / in the file path so that LaTeX can really find the animation file
  under Windows

    o ani.options() will perform a simple check on the validity of the
  options and issue warnings if the device and the file extension do
  not match, or the width and height for the pdf() device are greater
  than 100 inches



		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.0-2


NEW FEATURES

    o demo('IBM') to show IBM stock closing prices from 2000 to 2010

    o ani.record() gained a new argument 'replay.cur', which can be
  helpful when we want to capture low-level plot changes without
  storing all the plots in memory (default behaviour of ani.record())

    o a new function saveVideo() to convert a sequence of images to a
  video using FFmpeg (thanks, Thomas Julou)

    o we can easily create an animation using Rweb now; see a demo in
  system.file('misc', 'Rweb', 'demo.html', package = 'animation')

    o a new function qpdf() as a wrapper to the program 'qpdf', which
  is mainly used to compress the PDF files (it is recommended over
  Pdftk)

    o saveLatex() gained a new argument 'full.path': when the
  animation frames are not in the same directory with the LaTeX
  document, we can set full.path = TRUE to ensure LaTeX can find the
  image files

    o grad.desc() gained two new arguments: 'gr' to provide the
  gradient function, and 'main' to specify to title of the plot
  (thanks, Zeno Adams)

    o clt.ani() gained two arguments 'mean' and 'sd' to draw the
  theoretical limiting distribution

    o a new demo('ggobi_animation') to show how to record GGobi plots
  as an animation in the HTML file


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o saveMovie() was renamed to saveGIF() to better reflect what the
  function does; this change will not affect users because 'saveMovie'
  is still an alias to 'saveGIF' (i.e. they are identical)


MINOR CHANGES

    o saveSWF() puts all the image frames into the temp dir instead of
  ani.options('outdir') (similar to saveGIF())

    o the location of the argument 'img.name' was moved to the 3rd
  place in saveSWF() to be consistent to other saveXXX() functions

    o clt.ani() gained a new argument 'xlim' to set the x-axis limit
  of the histogram

    o knn.ani() gained the ... argument to pass additional arguments
  to create the empty "frame" for the animation


BUG FIXES

    o use packageDescription() instead of packageVersion() in
  saveHTML() and ani.stop() because there is a weird error reported
  when using packageVersion() (thanks, Alex Tek)



		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.0-1


NEW FEATURES

    o demo('Xmas_card') contributed by Yuan Huang

    o demo('flowers') to show how to download images from the Internet
  and create an animation

    o a new function pdftk() as a wrapper to call the Pdftk toolkit
  (mainly for compressing PDF graphics output)

    o saveLatex(), saveSWF() and saveMovie() can compress the PDF
  graphics using Pdftk (if available) now; if ani.options('ani.type')
  is 'pdf' and the 'pdftk' option is set, these functions will try the
  compression first

    o new functions ani.record() and ani.replay() to record and replay
  the animations; they can be used to capture the changes in the
  graphics made by low-level plotting commands (see ?ani.record for
  examples)


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o the function tidy.source() was completely removed from this
  package; users should go to the formatR package (tidy.source() is
  there now)


MINOR CHANGES

    o the argument 'expr' in saveHTML(), saveLatex(), saveMovie() and
  saveSWF() will be evaluated by eval(), so we may pass a real R
  expression (see ?expression) to 'expr', e.g. saveHTML(expression(for
  (i in 1:10) plot(runif(30)))); but note this argument does not *have
  to* be a real R expression -- you can still use an arbitrary R code
  chunk, e.g. saveHTML(for (i in 1:10) plot(runif(30))) (thanks,
  Aquery)



		  CHANGES IN animation VERSION 2.0-0


NEW FEATURES

    o a new demo 'Xmas2': Merry Christmas with snowflakes (see
  demo('Xmas2', 'animation'); thanks, Jing Jiao)

    o a new function saveHTML() to insert animations into HTML pages
  (this was designed to replace the old ani.start() and ani.stop();
  the output is much more appealing; the JavaScript is based on the
  SciAnimator library and jQuery)

    o ani.options() gained a new option 'autoplay' to indicate whether
  to autoplay the animation in the HTML page created by saveHTML()

    o in fact ani.options() was rewritten, but this should not have
  any influence on users; the usage is the same

    o ani.options() gained a new option 'use.dev' to decide whether to
  use the graphics device provided in ani.options('ani.dev') when
  calling saveHTML(), saveLatex(), saveMovie() and saveSWF()

    o ani.options() has a couple of hidden options ('convert',
  'swftools', 'img.fmt') which can be useful too; see ?ani.options for
  details

    o a new function ani.pause(): it is a wrapper to
  Sys.sleep(interval) but it will not pause when called in a
  non-interactive graphics device (usually the off-screen devices);
  this is the recommended way to specify the pause in the animation
  now -- all the functions in this package have been adjusted to use
  ani.pause()

    o a new demo('pollen') to show the hidden 'structure' in a large
  data (requires the rgl package)

    o a new demo('CLEvsLAL') to `replay' the NBA game between CLE and
  LAL on 2009 Christmas (with a new dataset 'CLELAL09')

    o a new demo('fireworks') to set fireworks using R (thanks,
  Weicheng Zhu)

    o saveLatex() can work with the rgl package to produce 3D animations
  in a PDF document now; see demo('rgl_animation')

    o a new demo('rgl_animation') to demonstrate how to insert rgl 3D
  animations into a LaTeX document and compile to PDF

    o a new demo('use_Cairo') to show how to use the Cairo device in
  this package to obtain high-quality output

    o a new demo('Sweave_animation') to show how to insert animations
  into Sweave documents

    o a new demo('game_of_life') to demonstrate the (amusing) Game of
  Life (thanks, Linlin Yan)


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o the documentation of this package has been tremendously revised;
  hopefully it is more clear to read now

    o several arguments in saveMovie(), im.convert(), saveSWF() and
  saveLatex() were removed, because they can be specified by
  ani.options(); this can simplify the usage of these functions


MINOR CHANGES

    o the argument 'para' in saveMovie() was removed; the argument
  'ani.first' was also removed from all the save*() functions, because
  this can be written in 'expr' and there is no need to provide an
  additional argument

    o the path of the output in im.convert() and gm.convert() will be
  quoted, because sometimes users might supply a path containing
  spaces (thanks, Phalkun Chheng)

    o the option 'filename' in ani.options() was renamed to 'htmlfile'
  so that the meaning of this option is more clear; 'footer' was
  renamed to 'verbose' too

    o ani.options() can accept any arguments now

    o im.convert() and gm.convert() will no longer stop() when the
  convert utility cannot be found; instead, they only issue warnings;
  a hidden option ani.options('convert') can be used to specify the
  location of convert.exe in ImageMagick

    o saveMovie(), saveHTML(), saveSWF() and saveLatex() will try to
  open the output if ani.options('autobrowse') is TRUE; and they will
  keep the current working directory untouched when evaluating 'expr'
  (i.e.  'expr' will be evaluated under getwd())




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.1-5


NEW FEATURES

    o the package has a NAMESPACE now (so .First.lib was changed to
  .onLoad accordingly)

    o im.convert() and gm.convert() can accept a vector of time
  intervals now (i.e. the time interval between image frames does not
  have to be a constant any more)

    o added a dataset 'iatemp' (yearly average temperature of central
  Iowa)

    o saveLatex() can be used in Sweave to dynamically insert PDF
  animations now -- it will automatically detect if it was called in
  Sweave and output the relevant LaTeX code to the LaTeX document

MINOR CHANGES

    o saveSWF() is using system() instead of shell() to call *2swf
  commands now



		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.1-4


NEW FEATURES

    o demo('Mandelbrot') shows the Mandelbrot set

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o the package is now maintained on GitHub
  (https://github.com/yihui/animation) and using roxygen to document
  functions

    o the functions highlight.def(), write.rss() and tidy.source()
  were defunct because they are irrelevant

    o ani.news() was removed from the package; we can use news(package
  = 'animation') instead

MINOR CHANGES

    o the MASS package is imported instead of being attached; in fact
  only lda() in MASS is used in the animation package.

    o fixed a buglet in saveMovie(): outdir does not actually work.

    o im.convert() will try to open the output using the default
  application in the OS (e.g.  using command 'xdg-open', or 'open')



		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.1-3


NEW FEATURES

    o demo('jumpingHorse') shows a horse jumping on the chess board
  (contributed by Linlin Yan)

    o A new function im.convert() which comes from saveMovie() but
  serves as a more general- purpose function; it can convert a series
  of files (not necessarily produced in R) to GIF/MPEG, and tries its
  best to find ImageMagick automatically (even you only have LyX
  installed) Thanks, Kelvin Lam.

MINOR CHANGES

    o saveMovie() gained a new argument 'fileext' to specify the file
  extension of the image frames (the old approach to get the file ext
  is not appropriate if we use other graphics devices, e.g. Cairo);
  meanwhile, saveMovie() now uses im.convert() to convert images to an
  animation file.

    o saveMovie() now generate the image frames in a temp directory
  and output the animation to the working directory by default
  (thanks, Thomas Julou)



		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.1-2


NEW FEATURES

    o demo('hanoi') will demonstrate the Tower of Hanoi game
  (contributed by Linlin Yan)

    o A new function sample.ratio() to demonstrate the advantage of
  ratio estimation in sampling survey. (thanks, Amber Watkins)

MINOR CHANGES

    o added a note for the function newton.method() that the argument
  'FUN' needs to be defined without braces. (thanks, Peter Ehlers)

    o fixed a bug in saveLatex(): the frame number should start with 0
  instead of 1. (thanks, Taiyun)



		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.1-1


NEW FEATURES

    o saveMovie() gained two new options: 'clean' to determin whether
  to delete individual image frames after conversion; 'cmd.fun' to
  decide which function to be used to invoke the OS command (system or
  shell)

MINOR CHANGES

    o improved the way to find 'convert' for saveMovie() under Windows
  which is a long-lasting confusing problem for Windows users (thanks,
  Yishuo Deng)

    o fixed a bug caused by the 'outdir' option in ani.options() when
  'outdir' is a relative path which makes ani.stop() fail (thanks,
  Paul Murrell)


		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.1-0


NEW FEATURES

    o three demos to illustrate recursion added: see
  demo('recur.leaf'), demo('recur.snow') and demo('recur.tree');
  thanks, Taiyun!

    o demo('Xmas') added

MINOR CHANGES

    o fixed a bug for the option 'interval': in the non-interactive
  environment, ani.start() and ani.stop() should use
  ani.options()$interval to obtain the REAL 'interval' (other than 0)

    o a new argument 'install.animate' for saveLatex() to install the
  LaTeX 'animate' if it does not exist

    o a new argument 'width.cutoff' for tidy.source() to decide the
  width of deparsed code

    o removed the code to install ImageMagick in saveMovie()

    o changed shell() to system() in saveMovie() (thanks, R. Woodrow
  Setzer)

    o updated the LaTeX package 'animate'



		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-10


NEW FEATURES

    o a new function MC.hitormiss() to demonstrate the 'hit or miss'
  Monte Carlo integration

    o a new function MC.samplemean() to demonstrate the 'sample mean'
  Monte Carlo integration

    o a new function price.ani() to demonstrate the stock prices
  changing within a time span (inspired by Shen Dai)

MINOR CHANGES

    o we can specify the 'convert' command in saveMovie();
  e.g. 'imconvert' under some Windows platforms (Thanks, James
  Pustejovsky)



		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-9


NEW FEATURES

    o saveLatex() to embed the animation into a LaTeX document (with
  LaTeX package 'animate').

    o a new option 'imgdir' added to ani.options() so that users can
  specify the name of the image directory

    o a message will come up if the animation option 'nmax' is
  changed; this will help users know the actual number of images in
  the current session; this message will only show in interactive mode

    o saveMovie() will try to install ImageMagick automatically if
  'convert' not found

MINOR CHANGES

    o query ani.options('interval') will return 0 if the animation is
  run in a non-interactive mode; this will save much time typically in
  'R CMD check' (Thanks to Prof Ripley)

    o the option 'nmax' will be adjusted to the *actual* number of
  images in the directory ani.options('imgdir'), because sometimes the
  actual number of images does not equal to ani.options('nmax')

    o shortened the descriptions in Rd files and several changes in
  documentations

    o fixed several buglets in ani.stop()

    o changed the 'while' loop to 'for' loop in brownian.motion();
  this will shorten the code by two lines

    o ani.options('ani.dev') can be the name of a function
  (character), e.g. "png"



		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-8


NEW FEATURES

    o ecol.death.sim() to simulate the death of two species in a field

MINOR CHANGES

    o fixed an error in the example of HuSpeech




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-7


NEW FEATURES

    o moving.block() to plot a subset of data by blocks

    o ani.options() gained a new argument 'loop' to control the
  iteration of the animation in an HTML page: TRUE to interate for
  infinite times, and FALSE not to interate (only play once). Thanks,
  Marcin Kozak!

MINOR CHANGES

    o fixed a bug for in ani.stop(): when ani.options(footer = FALSE),
  ani.stop() will report an error for non-existent object 'footer'; I
  should have used the value ani.options("footer") in the code.
  Thanks, Marcin Kozak!




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-6


NEW FEATURES

    o new function sim.qqnorm() to demonstrate QQ plots for random
  numbers from Normal dist'n.




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-5


NEW FEATURES

    o new demo 'Sierpinski' for Sierpinski triangle; see
  demo(Sierpinski).

    o ani.options('footer') was changed to allow a custom string to be
  written in the HTML page as the footer information. (Thanks, Jorge
  Nieves)

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o tidy.source2() was merged into tidy.source(), and tidy.source()
  now returns a list of character vectors and also gains an argument
  'output' to decide whether to output the tidied code (to R console
  or a file).




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-4


NEW FEATURES

    o tidy.source2() is a improved version of tidy.source(); it
  preserves some comments in R code.

MINOR CHANGES

    o fixed a bug for normalizePath() in saveMovie() and saveSWF().





		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-3


NEW FEATURES

    o The famous 'pollen' data added. See the example for finding the
  letters hidden in the data.

    o A function quincunx() added to simulate the Galton box or Bean
  Machine. (Thanks for the inspiration from Roger Koenker)

    o A function least.squares() added to show the ordinary least
  square process. (Thanks for the inspiration from Daniel Goldstein)

    o A function BM.circle() added to show the Brownian Motion in a
  circle.

    o A function g.brownian.motion() added to demonstrate the Brownian
  Motion using Google Visulization API.

MINOR CHANGES

    o The Shapiro-Wilk normality tests are performed to independent
  sample means instead of the original 'cumulative' data. (Thanks,
  Duncan Murdoch)

    o Arguments 'col.contour' and 'col.arrow' added to grad.desc() to
  specify the colors for the contour lines and arrows freely; the
  graphical parameters are no longer specified within the function
  using par().

    o The path of SWF Tools in saveSWF() will be quoted by shQuote()
  instead of dQuote().  (Thanks, zhoulvjun)




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-2


NEW FEATURES

    o A new function Rosling.bubbles() added to show the bubbles
  animations like those used in Hans Rosling's talk.

MINOR CHANGES

    o The argument 'swftools' is double quoted so that the SWF
  utilities can be executed correctly when the path contains
  spaces. (Thanks, Geng Yang)




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-1


NEW FEATURES

    o The package has provided a wrapper to produce Flash animations
  using SWF Tools: saveSWF()

    o A demo 'wordrotation' added to show the basic method to make
  animations. More demos will be added in future releases.

MINOR CHANGES

    o A new argument 'para' added to saveMovie() so that the graphics
  parameters can be set for the device.




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 1.0-0


NEW FEATURES

    o ani.options() added to control animation parameters.  It is much
  better than ani.control() in previous versions.

    o ani.start() and ani.stop() are modified. The former function
  opens a graphics device and the latter one create an HTML page with
  a new interface.

    o A wiki has been build to support this package:
  http://animation.yihui.name (AniWiki: Animations in Statistics)

MINOR CHANGES

    o Graphical parameters can be set in ... argument for:
  brownian.motion(), buffon.needle(), clt.ani(), conf.int(), cv.ani(),
  lln.ani(), mwar.ani(), newton.method(), sample.cluster(),
  sample.strat().

    o P-values are computed in clt.ani() to check the normality (using
  'shapiro.test()').

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o The vignette is abandoned and stopped being updated; the wiki
  http://animation.yihui.name will be used instead.

    o The way to create HTML animations is significantly changed for
  the sake of a better interface and more flexible control of
  animations. Read the help files for ani.control(), ani.start(),
  ani.stop().

    o The function savePNG() removed. The new way to create animation
  frames allows ANY graphics devices.

    o ani.control() and checkargs() removed. The new way to control
  animation parameters is more flexible.





		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.2-0


NEW FEATURES

    o cv.nfeaturesLDA() to illustrate the process of k-fold
  cross-validation to find the optimum number of features in LDA.

MINOR CHANGES

    o A rectangular grid has been added to the plot in kmeans.ani() so
  that the moving of centers can be better observed.

    o The default value for the argument "source" is set to be
  "clipboard".

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o The code for clt.ani() has been modified to make better
  illustrations for the CLT.




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-8


MINOR CHANGES

    o the function flip.coin() is slightly modified (a new argument
  'grid' added and the digits of probabilities in the graph can be
  controlled)




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-7


NEW FEATURES

    o conf.int() to illustrate the concept of confidence intervals.

    o lln.ani() to illustrate the Law of Large Numbers.

    o grad.desc() for the Gradient Descent Algorithm.

    o bisection.method() for the illustration of the Bisection method.

    o newton.method() for the demonstration of Newton-Raphson method.


MINOR CHANGES

    o A special function checkargs() is added to validate animation
  arguments, which can promote the efficiency of animation functions.

    o It doesn't need Sys.sleep() when creating HTML pages, so the
  code is modified to avoid suspending in this case.




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-6


NEW FEATURES

    o saveMovie() to create single movies using ImageMagick.


MINOR CHANGES

    o The number of tosses is added to the plot in flip.coin().




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-5


NEW FEATURES

    o cli.ani() to illustrate the Centrol Limit Theorem (CLT).

    o vi.grid.illusion() to illustrate two kinds of grid illusions
  (Scintillating grid illusion and Hermann grid illusion).


MINOR CHANGES

    o Argument '...' added to tidy.source() for more flexible control
  of the output.




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-4


NEW FEATURES

    o write.rss() for creating RSS feed files from a CSV file
  containing RSS items.

    o vi.lilac.chaser() for the visual illusion 'Lilac Chaser'.

MINOR CHANGES

    o The capability of PNG device is checked before creating png
  image files in savePNG().

    o A bug in the assigning of 'interval' in the environment 'ANIenv'
  was fixed.




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-3


NEW FEATURES

    o A new function highlight.def() added to dynamically generate the
  R definition file for the software Highlight.

    o mwar.ani() to show moving window auto-regression.

    o sample.simple() for simple random sampling without replacement.

    o sample.strat() for stratified sampling.

    o sample.cluster for cluster sampling.

    o sample.system() for systematic sampling.

MINOR CHANGES

    o The string 'file://' was added before the path of the HTML
  animation page to avoid the error caused by browseURL in ani.stop().

    o File 'ANI.css' and 'FUN.js' were moved to the directory 'js'
  (because they are not 'data'). Both files were modified slightly.

    o The parameter for time interval can be passed to the HTML
  animation page now.

    o The vignette was supplemented and modified accordingly.




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-2


MINOR CHANGES

    o An argument 'col' added to flip.coin() to control colors of each
  face of the coin.

    o The 'pageview' data updated to Dec 3, 2007.

    o Points that have already been classified in knn.ani() are marked
  out in later steps of classification for the rest points.

    o The values of PI are silently returned in buffon.needle().

    o The result for the test set can be returned in knn.ani().

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o The computation for kfcv() is changed so that the sample sizes
  will be more 'uniformly' allocated.

    o A new function ani.control() added so that the controlling
  parameters can be more uniform and the scalability of the animation
  functions will also be better. All the animation functions are
  chanaged accordingly.




		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-1


NEW FEATURES

    o A news-reading function ani.news() added so that changes will be
  conveniently known.

    o boot.iid() is available for demonstration of bootstrapping i.i.d
  data.


MINOR CHANGES

    o The arguments ... is added in animation functions to control PNG
  image files.

    o The sample data is permuted before cv.ani() so that every time
  we do cross-validation, the splitting of trainig set and test set
  will change (instead of splitting 1:n into k parts). The tick marks
  of x-axis will change accordingly.





		CHANGES IN animation VERSION 0.1-0

    o ani.start() to start an HTML page for animations.

    o ani.stop() to complete the HTML animation page.

    o brownian.motion() to demonstrate Brownian motion in the 2D
  plane.

    o buffon.needle() to simulate the process of Buffon's needle.

    o cv.ani() to demonstrate k-fold cross validation.

    o flip.coin() to simulate tossing 'coins'.

    o kfcv() to compute sample sizes for k-fold cross-validation.

    o kmeans.ani() to show the process of K-Means cluster analysis.

    o knn.ani() to show k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

    o savePNG() to save PNG image files which constitute the basic
  animation frames in the HTML page.

    o tidy.source() is a trivial function to 'tidy up' R code using
  the internal R function parse().

    o 'pageview' is a daily page view data of my personal website.
