lln.ani(FUN = rnorm, mu = 0, np = 30, pch = 20, col.poly = "bisque", col.mu = "gray", 
    ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{FUN}{a function to generate random numbers from a certain distribution:
\code{function(n, mu)}}

\item{mu}{population mean; passed to \code{FUN}}

\item{np}{times for sampling from a distribution (not the sample size!); to
examine the behaviour of the sample mean, we need more times of sampling to
get a series of mean values}

\item{pch}{symbols for points; see Details}

\item{col.poly}{the color of the polygon to annotate the range of sample
means}

\item{col.mu}{the color of the horizontal line which denotes the population
mean}

\item{\dots}{other arguments passed to \code{\link{points}}}
}
\value{
None (invisible \code{NULL}).
}
\description{
This function plots the sample mean as the sample size grows to check whether
the sample mean approaches to the population mean.
}
\details{
\code{np} points are plotted to denote the distribution of the sample mean;
we will observe that the range of the sample mean just becomes smaller and
smaller as the sample size increases and ultimately there will be an obvious
trend that the sample mean converges to the population mean \code{mu}.

The parameter \code{nmax} in \code{\link{ani.options}} means the maximum
sample size.
}
\note{
The argument \code{pch} will influence the speed of plotting, and for a
  very large sample size (say, 300), it is suggested that this argument be
  specified as `\code{.}'.
